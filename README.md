# Basic_pyQGIS_script
Very simple script to apply an expression with QgsRasterCalculator to a Raster layer.

This script should be run in the QGIS Python Console. In this current version it will take a raster layer from the QGIS project, it will create a QgsRasterCalculator object and then it will write and load in the project a new raster file after applying a simple expression (the variable "expression" in the script).
